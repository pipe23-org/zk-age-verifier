# Configuration

The verifier reads a TOML file with two tables, `[service]` and `[trust]`, passed with
`--config`. Scalar values can be overridden with environment variables.

## [service]

- `expected_origin` (required) — the origin the service accepts presentations for, a bare
  `scheme://host[:port]`. The origin is hashed into the presentation transcript, so it must 
   correspond to the origin that the presentation asserts.
- `pylongfellow.backend` (default `google-cpp`) — the proof engine, see
  [Proof engine](#proof-engine).
- `session_ttl_seconds` (default `300`) — seconds a session stays usable after creation.
- `session_cap` (default `1000`) — maximum live sessions; session creation is rejected at
  the cap. Expired sessions are swept before the cap is enforced.
- `timestamp_skew_seconds` (default `300`) — allowed difference in either direction between
  the proof timestamp and the verifier clock.
- `cors_allowed_origins` (default empty) — origins granted cross-origin access to the API.
  An empty list sends no CORS headers.

## [trust]

`[[trust.sources]]` entries form a non-empty list. Each entry sets exactly one of:

- `pem` — a PEM file, or a directory whose `*.pem` files are all loaded.
- `etsi_xml` — an ETSI trusted list, path or URL; its certificates become anchors.

Every listed anchor is authorized to vouch for age credentials; a mixed-purpose or broad
list authorizes every CA on it as an age-credential issuer. Sources that resolve to zero
anchors fail startup.

## Environment variables

`ZK_AGE_VERIFIER_SECTION__KEY` overrides a scalar value: `ZK_AGE_VERIFIER_` is the prefix
and `__` separates nesting levels, so `ZK_AGE_VERIFIER_SERVICE__PYLONGFELLOW__BACKEND`
overrides `pylongfellow.backend` under `[service]`. 

Lists and tables — a `[[trust.sources]]` entry, `cors_allowed_origins` — cannot be set from the environment 
and must be written in the TOML file.

`LOG_FORMAT=console` switches log output from JSON lines to console rendering. It is read
from the environment only and takes no prefix.

## Proof engine

The `pylongfellow.backend` key selects the proof engine the service verifies with.
Registry names: `google-cpp` (google/longfellow-zk), `isrg-rust`
(abetterinternet/zk-cred-longfellow). Both ship in the default pylongfellow install. An
unknown or unbuilt name fails startup.

Open issues on [pylongfellow](https://github.com/pipe23-org/pylongfellow) detail any known problems
with these backends.
