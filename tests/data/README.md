# Test data

Bytes the tests read but did not produce.

- `upstream-verifier-service-request.json` — the example request body for google/longfellow-zk's
  reference verifier service. A JSON object with two base64 fields: `Transcript` (an
  OpenID4VP DC-API handover) and `ZKDeviceResponseCBOR` (a CBOR DeviceResponse carrying one
  `zkDocuments` entry). The ZK document is an `org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL` proof at circuit v6; its
  `zkSystemId` is a bare circuit hash, and its `documentData` has no `deviceSigned` key.

  `fe83ec6c4efa5f98bc2439c8b06e5eccd153aca0` — pylongfellow's pinned submodule SHA, the SHA of
  record for all longfellow-zk-derived material here (byte-identical at upstream `90bb3c9`,
  the clone HEAD it was physically copied from). Captured 2026-07-14. Copied verbatim.
  google/longfellow-zk is Apache-2.0, the same licence as this repository.
- `v6-1attr.circuit`, `v6-1attr.json` — the circuit the request's proof was generated
  against, with its sidecar record. Copied verbatim from pipe23-org/pylongfellow
  `tests/differential/circuits/` at `5b3efdf98d7ce362a6e5862e48cb5bef002c6616` on
  2026-07-30; the sidecar's `origin` records the google/longfellow-zk artifact it was
  exported from.
- `mdl-age-over-18-presentation.json` — the request's verify input set as recorded in
  pylongfellow's differential corpus: transcript, issuer public key, timestamp, and
  requested attributes. Copied verbatim from pipe23-org/pylongfellow
  `tests/differential/presentations/mdl-age-over-18/presentation.json` at the same
  commit and date. Its transcript equals `upstream-verifier-service-request.json`'s
  `Transcript` field byte-for-byte; `tests/integration/test_mdl_specimen.py` asserts
  the equality.
- `av-issuer-ca-01.pem` — the Commission's Age Verification test IACA, "Age Verification
  Issuer CA 01": self-signed, `CA:TRUE`, keyUsage `keyCertSign` and `cRLSign`, valid to
  2034-09-27. Its non-critical `issuerAltName` (2.5.29.18) does not decode as `GeneralNames`:
  the extension value carries a second copy of the whole extension, whose inner URI is tagged
  `[2] dNSName` rather than `[6] uniformResourceIdentifier`. `cryptography` decodes every
  extension whose OID it recognises, so reading `Certificate.extensions` on this file raises
  `ValueError`. Source: eu-digital-identity-wallet/av-srv-web-issuing-avw-py
  `api_docs/test_tokens/IACA-token/AgeVerificationIssuer.IACA.01.EU.pem` (Apache-2.0).
  Captured 2026-07-08. Copied verbatim; byte-identical to
  `examples/site-dc-mdoc/anchors/eu-av-test.pem`.
- `av-document-signer-001.pem` — the document signer under that CA, "Age Verification DS -
  001": keyUsage `digitalSignature`, valid to 2026-09-24, and its signature verifies against
  `av-issuer-ca-01.pem`. Its `issuerAltName` value is byte-identical to the CA's, so reading
  `Certificate.extensions` raises the same `ValueError`. Implementations produce that by
  copying the issuer certificate's extension verbatim; multipaz does so in
  `multipaz-server/.../ServerIdentity.kt`, citing ISO 18013-5 table B.3. Source:
  eu-digital-identity-wallet/av-dc-api-backend
  `environment/trust-anchors/age-verification-testing-issuer.pem` (Apache-2.0) at clone HEAD
  `24180068`. Captured 2026-08-04. Copied verbatim.
